Students' project for the 2014 ShanghAI Lectures

Find the KÃµan description here:

Please check the documents in the "docs" folder and add things if you like.

If you haven't worked with Git before, I suggest you read:
https://progit.org/
Chapter 1 and 2 give a brief summary of why and how to use Git.

Chapter 3 explains how branches work.

Chapter 6 explains how to use Git with GitHub. 
We will add branches to the project once the workload is split into the local groups.

If you have any problems running Git or need help setting it up, 
feel free to contact Maria (12xU).
